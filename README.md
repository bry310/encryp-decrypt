## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Don’t stay behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.




## Stage 1/6: Encrypted! <a name="stage-1"></a>
* ## `Description`
    Today, encryption and decryption algorithms are everywhere to protect our data. They are vital for sites that handle sensitive data, such as e-commerce sites that accept online card payments and login areas that require users to enter their credentials. Complex encryption algorithms are behind the scenes to ensure the security of data.

    In this project, you will learn how to encrypt and decrypt messages and texts using simple algorithms. We should note that such algorithms are not suitable for industrial use because they can easily be cracked, but these algorithms illustrate general ideas of encryption.

* ## `Objectives`
    In the first stage, you need to manually encrypt the message we found a treasure! and print only the ciphertext (in lower case).

    To encrypt a message, replace each letter with the letter that is in the corresponding position from the end of the English alphabet (a→z, b→y, c→x, ... x→c, y →b, z→a). Do not replace spaces or exclamation marks.

    Use the given template to your program to print the ciphertext instead of the original message.

    The output should look like ## ##### # ########! where # is a lower-case English letter.
